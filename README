Extra batteries for Python.

Every time you copy-and-paste code into a utils.py God kills a Unicorn.
Please do not repeat yourself. Evolve this library instead.

The library works with Python 2.5+, PyPy, and Python 3.x.
The RSA cryptography modules depend on pyasn1, which has not
been ported to Python 3.x, so this is pending.

I cannot stress the important fact enough. STOP COPY PASTING.
I would release this using a "DO NOT COPY-PASTE SNIPPETS" license if I could.
Use the library and contribute better code if you can.
